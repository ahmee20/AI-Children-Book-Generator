# AI-Children-Book-Generator
This project is an end-to-end automated AI-powered children's storybook generator built using n8n. It takes a child’s reference image and story inputs, analyzes facial features using computer vision APIs, and generates a fully illustrated personalized children's book with consistent character appearance across all scenes.
